Harvard CS50 stock simulation web

This is a homework-set created by Harvard CS50.
The project asked us to implement a simulation website that can register, login, search, buy, sell, and browse transaction history.
The staff already set up some of the basic template for us, all we have to do is to complete the functions and the correspond html files.

You are welcome the play with this project and report any bugs or feedback.
